Wormhole

Scientist have recently discovered how to make a magnetic worm hole in the laboratory. "Wormholes are fascinating cosmological objects that can connect two distant regions of the universe. Because of their intriguing nature, constructing a wormhole in a lab seems a formidable task." You can find the article here:[http://www.sciencealert.com/a-magnetic-wormhole-that-connects-two-regions-of-space-has-been-created-for-the-first-time][0]. Yes this is the stuff in science fiction we've all heard about for years. It seems to be common knowledge in the world. Ask anyone about worm holes in space and they'll have an idea of what you are talking about. .

There is another type of worm hole that most people don't know about but use it and experience it all the time, this "wormhole" is intuition and the ability to reach across time and space with intention and heal someone or to know something. This wormhole is how energy healing works. It's part of the stuff that physics use to access information about the past and future and read your energy field.

Scientists may have created a worm hole in the lab but energy healers create them every day and use them to heal others at a distance, and it works. This really in my mind should be the head line.

**"Healers reach through time and space to heal your soul your energy field and prevent illness cure "incurable" disease and sooth the soul."**

When I read the head line about worm holes in the laboratory I immediately thought to myself "thats what am I doing when I'm giving a distant energy healing!"

The light bulb went off and I knew that wormholes can be created by our minds, by mental activity which is magnetic and electric. Now maybe not a wormhole you could step through to another galaxy but one that connects one soul to another. A wormhole that connects healing energy through to another person or place or thing. A worm hole that allows a trained medical intuitive to see inside your body and see what others can't see with machines. Machines can't tell you what emotion is causing your illness and discomfort machines can't asses the function of an organ and balance it to it's corresponding energy center.well I take that back some can just not ones your going to see in the doctors office.

When I'm giving a distant energy healing I connect to my client with my intention, just my mental and focused energy, my desire to connect with a specific person with kindness.

Which is amazing to me and really incredible if you think about it, I am sitting in my living room and my client is in their house half way across the world. And and I am connecting with their energy body that connects to their internal organs and emotions, their stories their history for all their lives.. This is my life I'm working in the unseen rhelms, the space between atoms that permeates everything and that connects us all, we are all part of this space. This space is continuous and is all here all now.

I don't know why we don't learn this in kindergarten
