Now maybe not a wormhole you could step through to another galaxy but one that connects one soul to another. A wormhole that connects healing energy through to another person or place or thing. A worm hole that allows a trained medical intuitive to see inside your body and see what others can’t see with machines. Machines can’t tell you what emotion is causing your illness and discomfort machines can’t asses the function of an organ and balance it to it’s corresponding energy center.well I take that back some can just not ones your going to see in the doctors office.</p><p>When I’m giving a distant energy healing I connect to my client with my intention, just my mental and focused energy, my desire to connect with a specific person with kindness.</p><p>Which is amazing to me and really incredible if you think about it, I am sitting in my living room and my client is in their house half way across the world.
